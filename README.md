# Connect four

## About

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where the goal is to be the first to line up four of your colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a grid of six rows and seven columns. It's a fast-paced and engaging game of skill and tactics.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Development

To run the game locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

- Install dependencies

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

- Start the development console

    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```

### Recommended extensions

Since the project is developed using a linter, it's recommended to install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension.

#### ESLint usage

You can lint automatically by running the following command, since ESLint is installed as a development dependency:

```shell
npm run lint
```

Or you can use the ESLint extension manually by running the following command:

```shell
npx eslint
```
